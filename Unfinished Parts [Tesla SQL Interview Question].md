QNS: Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query that determines which parts with the 
assembly steps have initiated the assembly process but remain unfinished.

Assumptions:
parts_assembly table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.
An unfinished part is one that lacks a finish_date.
This question is straightforward, so let's approach it with simplicity in both thinking and solution.
Effective April 11th 2023, the problem statement and assumptions were updated to enhance clarity.

parts_assembly Table

| Column Name | Type     |
|-------------|----------|
| part        | string   |
| finish_date | datetime |
| assembly_step | integer |

parts_assembly Example Input

| part    | finish_date            | assembly_step |
|---------|-----------------------|---------------|
| battery | 01/22/2022 00:00:00    | 1             |
| battery | 02/22/2022 00:00:00    | 2             |
| battery | 03/22/2022 00:00:00    | 3             |
| bumper  | 01/22/2022 00:00:00    | 1             |
| bumper  | 02/22/2022 00:00:00    | 2             |
| bumper  |                        | 3             |
| bumper  |                        | 4             |

Example Output:
| part   | assembly_step |
|--------|---------------|
| bumper | 3             |
| bumper | 4             |

The bumpers in step 3 and 4 are the only item that remains unfinished as it lacks a recorded finish date.

```SQL
Solution:
select part,assembly_step from parts_assembly where finish_date is null
```
